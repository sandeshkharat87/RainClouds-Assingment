       "'Sure, I can provide some critical CIS rules to follow when setting up a Linux Server on GCP based on the provided context:\\n\\n1. GCP-CIS Rule Number: 3.6 - Ensure That SSH Access Is Restricted From the Internet. You should restrict SSH access to your instances from the internet by creating GCP Firewall Rules that only allow traffic from specific sources.\\n\\n2. GCP-CIS Rule Number: 6.5 - Ensure That Cloud SQL Database Instances Do Not Implicitly Whitelist All Public IP Addresses. If you are using Cloud SQL databases, you should restrict access to them from public IP addresses and only allow traffic from trusted networks or IPs.\\n\\n3. GCP-CIS Rule Number: 4.8 - Ensure Compute Instances Are Launched With Shielded VM Enabled. When launching your compute instances, you should enable Shielded VMs to defend against advanced threats and ensure that the boot loader and firmware on your VMs are signed and untampered.\\n\\n4. GCP-CIS Rule Number: 1.3 - Ensure that Security Key Enforcement is Enabled for All Admin Accounts. You should set up Security Key Enforcement for Google Cloud Platform admin accounts with Organization Administrator roles to protect them with the strongest form of two-factor authentication and prevent phishing attacks.\\n\\nThese are just a few critical CIS rules to follow when setting up a Linux Server on GCP. Remember to follow all relevant CIS rules and guidelines to ensure the security and compliance of your GCP environment.'"
